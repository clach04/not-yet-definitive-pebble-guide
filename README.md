## Building

### Local

  * Docker and the Pebble emulator https://github.com/clach04/docker-pebble-dev/wiki
  * Pebble Development Setup https://github.com/andyburris/pebble-setup
  * Rebble Help SDK FAQ https://help.rebble.io/sdk/

### Under CI / GitHub Actions

So far only GitHub Actions available

  * see https://github.com/kristofwillen/Pebble-NMBS for docker based build under GitHub actions
  * https://github.com/clach04/github_action_pebble_build - Pebble GitHub Actions for building
      * See a demo at https://github.com/clach04/pebble_watchface_framework

### CloudPebble

Requires the most work and not recommended:

  * Self hosted (with limitations) https://github.com/gfunkmonk/cloudpebble-composed WARNING not considered safe to expose publicly (from original author in Discord https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/407270816997441547/1014688058685259817)

### Frameworks

TODO URLs needed

#### Libraries

  * https://github.com/LeFauve/pebble_memory_tools


#### On Pebble/Phone

  * plain C with Pebble SDK
  * C + js with Pebble SDK and PebbleKitjs
  * Javascript:
      * Rocky.js
      * Pebble.js
      * Simply.js
  * Companion SDK
  * Python on Pebble https://github.com/hiway/pybble
  * UI mocking / preview
      * https://github.com/gregoiresage/pebble-image-viewer https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/53bdb1291c6da72083000044?query=Image&section=watchapps
      * Preview App by Tack Mobile https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/56240ecbbdf1bfb3cb00009e?query=Image&section=watchapps

#### Services/APIs

  * https://github.com/clach04/pypebbleapi - Python client library for Timeline (specifically Rebble Timeline service)

#### Desktop/command line tools

NOTe there are improvements and fixes for existing tools, you may have to find them. For example see unmerged PRs:


  * https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebble-tool/pulls - for example allow logging to be ran from Windows
  * https://github.com/pebble/clay/pulls - working pebble clay config in the emulator on a modern desktop browser

##### Third Party Tools

  * https://github.com/clach04/python-pebble-tools process locker
  * https://github.com/clach04/pebble_patch_tts voice dictation patching to remove punctuation, relies on rockgarden
  * https://github.com/clach04/Pebble-App-Config-Page-Backup backup of (most) pebble config URLs
  * reverse enginering:
      * radare2/r2 - https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/issues/20002 https://www.reddit.com/r/pebbledevelopers/comments/uc50kw/reverse_engineeringdecompiling_with_radare2r2/
      * extracting assets
          * PBW files are simply ZIP files, js is easily extractable and can be updated and injected back into the PBW without any other steps (i.e. no checksum, metadata/manifest updates, etc.
  
### Hacking tools

  * https://github.com/southwolf/pbw-tools
  * https://github.com/clach04/rockgarden patch and hack watchfaces and apps - working fork of https://github.com/cpfair/rockgarden
      * For example with use with https://github.com/clach04/pebble_patch_tts
  * https://github.com/cpfair/sand - Remix Pebble apps
  * https://github.com/sethasaurus/pebble-pyrite
  * [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/) and a [text](https://scintilla.org/SciTE.html) [editor](https://www.vim.org/)
      * Most config/internet access can be modified/fixed/hacked via:
         1. Extract the javascript from PBW using any zip extractor
         2. edit javascript
         3. rezip up the PBW
      * A typical use case is to change the settings page or modify [weather lookup](https://github.com/clach04/pebble-forecaswatch2-fcsw2-fcw2/blob/6ae4f1f7cde3a32144d20821fb1a425b89122864/src/pkjs/weather/openweathermap.js#L26). 

## Dev notes

### Tips

#### Pebble Debug Logs

Once Developer mode is enabled in the Pebble App on the phone:

    pebble logs --phone IP_ADDRESS

Will display all logs, from C code and js code.

This works under Windows, not just Unix-like platforms:

    python2 -m pip install -e git+https://github.com/clach04/pebble-tool.git@windows_py27#egg=pebble-tool

#### Hung Pebble emulator

If Pebble emulator is hung

1. Issue `pebble kill`
2. Manually stop/kill any remaining pebble (emulator) processes
3. Issue `pebble wipe`

### SDK notes

  * latest 4.x
  * SDK 3.x - can be used to build PBWs that run on Firmware 4.x
  * SDK 2 - has incompatablities with SDK1
  * SDK 1 - do NOT use
