# Pebble with Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) and diabetes monitoring


## Pebble Software in the Rebble Store

  * Watchfaces https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/search/watchfaces/1?native=false&query=cgm
  * Apps https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/search/watchapps/1?query=cgm

There a mix of faces/apps.

  * Some work with Dexcom Share service - and work with regular off-the-shelf software - works with Android and iOS
    Requires an internet connection to function
  * Some work with open source data hubs, typically Android only. For example, [Nightscout xDrip+](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip), xDrip, etc.
    Some can be used offline (without internet access) some make use of a custom online server that requires an internet connection

For non-tech-savy users, Dexcom Share is probably the option to check out first.
